#### TOOLS
***nollymemes*** was built with React with other dependencies like framer-motion for the animations and react-spinners for the page loader. This is the first version and it has no search functionality on purpose. The reason for this is as a fan of memes, I rarely type in a search keyword whenever I need a meme, I just scroll through the memes I have and then I find one that captures that moment.
